- What I learned today?
- What do you remember that you *think* is important.
    - What is the CLR? A runtime that runs our applications.

    - What is IL code? It is code used by the compilers which stands for intermediate lanuage.

    - What is the entry point for a .net application? The startup class or the main method.

    - What is ".Net Core" and why was it important? It makes .Net -> cross platform (able to run on windows, max or linux)



- What I need to learn more about
    - What is an "HTTP API?"
    - What is MapGet
    - Builder & Services 
        

- Below is a snippet of what we did today and what I learned.
```csharp


using HelloWorld;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

//do some configuration of the services (none for this one now)
builder.Services.AddSingleton<DateUtils>(); 
var app = builder.Build();


app.MapGet("/break/{minutes:int}", (int minutes, DateUtils utils) =>
{
    //return Results.Ok("Take a break! for " + minutes);

    
    var response = new BreakTimerResponse(
        minutes,
        DateTime.Now,
        utils.TakeABreak(minutes)
        );

    return Results.Ok(response);

});

app.Run(); // "Blocking"

public record BreakTimerResponse(int Minutes, DateTime StartTime, DateTime EndTime);

```
