# Day 6 of Intro To Programming


## Angular Stuff

Here is an example of a reducer:

```ts
import { createReducer, on } from "@ngrx/store";
import { CounterCommands } from "../actions/count-actions";


export interface CountState {
    current: number;
    by: 1 | 3 | 5
}

const initialState:CountState = {
    current: 0,
    by: 1
}

export const reducer = createReducer(initialState,
    on(CounterCommands.countby, (s,a) => ({...s, by: a.by})),
    on(CounterCommands.reset, (s) => ({...s, current: 0})),
    on(CounterCommands.incremented, (currentState) => ({...currentState, current: currentState.current + currentState.by})),
    on(CounterCommands.decremented, (s) => ({...s, current: s.current - s.by}))
);
```

## What is an object spread operator?

Upon further research using the mdn web docs, it is syntax that allows an iterable, like an array or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (in regards to function calls) or elements are expected. -> (...)

I've learned a lot of useful things today especially in regards to angular. I'm very excited to start using a lot of this new knowledge and hopefully I get to introduce it on many projects i work on in the future.
