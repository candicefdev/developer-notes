-Today we did a lot of unit testing. 
We started off with small unit tests then we gradually got to even bigger and more intertwined unit tests. One of those unit tests were called the Banking Unit test. I think I actually remember doing something similar in an online Microsoft DotNet course. I can't remember if it was as advanced but I do remember making unit tests for a small bank/bank account. It was nice seeing something that looked somewhat similar.
